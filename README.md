Data Manipulation and Treatment using Oracle, Pandas, and Python

This repository contains a collection of code aimed at training and testing data manipulation and treatment techniques using Oracle, Pandas, and Python. The primary objective of this project is to showcase effective ways to import, process, and treat data from CSV files before inserting it into a database.

**Built with:**

Python | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) | ORM (SQLAlchemy) | Relational database | Oracle


Main Features:

Data Import: CSV files containing raw data are imported into the Python environment using Pandas dataframes.

Data Transformation: Various data manipulation techniques are employed to clean, filter, and preprocess the imported data.

Data Treatment: The treated data is carefully prepared to resolve missing values, handle outliers, and address other data quality issues.

Database Integration: The processed data is efficiently inserted into an Oracle database for long-term storage and analysis.
